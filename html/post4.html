                    <h3>MUSIC CAREER IN CHURCH - POSSIBLE OR NOT</h3>
                    <p>
                         There is a career part of the gospel music industry! There is no debating it.
                        While we debunk the excesses of gospel singers, we can't deny the financial realities.
                        Music is expensive, very! From studio production to marketing to video shoots, the whole 
                        way down! You can't possibly expect singers to spend huge resources making music and they 
                        won't charge. I mean, there is a reason Pastors sell our books, yeah? There is a reason 
                        some pastors even charge for folks to access their messages. And yep, we all have church 
                        staff that are paid, some heavily paid. You can't just claim that the fellow servicing the 
                        generator is serving God and shouldn't be paid or the fellow who handles the precious gadgets 
                        we bought with millions. These are the realities. Yep, the singers may have become unruly and 
                        ambitious or even worldly but we can't just ignore the facts. Meanwhile, we were also wrong to 
                        assume anyone who has a gospel music career is a minister in God's house. They are not like choir 
                        members who seek no financial gain or renumeration from their service in God's house. These people 
                        are career folks and we better settle with that reality. No need mixing it up. No need at all.
                        We have to be comfortable with them having their career without assuming they are part of our choir.
                        That's the fact. We should be more concerned about their worldliness than trying to de-emphasize their 
                        career or role. There will always be need for gospel music. We will always need the gospel alternative 
                        to worldly songs. Or would you suggest gospel drama outlets should also close up and they shouldn't sell 
                        their movies or generate monies from it? Or maybe folks should stop selling bibles because it is God's word.
                        Or folks who make gospel cartoon for kids don't need to monetise that because it is gospel.
                        A fellow was even angry gospel artists actually have copyright laws guiding the use of the work, he suppose 
                        it shouldn't be so, since it is gospel music. Interesting, because same person will be angry to see another 
                        Pastor plagarise his own pastor's Facebook posts. Let's keep a cerebral perspective while we discuss these issues.
                        You know I am never one to lose my intelligence while reasoning doctrinally, intelligence is a gift, not a curse, 
                        as long as it is submissive to God's word. I always wonder why we always run into extremes in a bid to correct 
                        extremes, we just like to destroy everything!! Can we really say no good has come out of the numerous gospel art 
                        in Nigeria? Huh? No good? All of a sudden the HolySpirit is angry and wants us to discard it all together?
                        Nah, I think we are overreacting. It is not that deep!
